# BEAMX

## AI-Powered Memecoin Launch Platform

### üöÄ Project Overview

This application revolutionizes memecoin creation by leveraging the power of [`Brian AI`](https://docs.brianknows.org/brian-api/apis) and the [`Unruggable Meme SDK`](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/unruggable.meme). Our platform democratizes blockchain token generation, enabling users to launch memecoins through simple, natural language prompts.

#### üåê [Live Site](https://beamx.vercel.app](https://beamx-meme.vercel.app/)

### ‚ú® Key Features

#### 1. AI-Powered Token Creation

- Natural Language Processing: Transform creative ideas into blockchain tokens
- Intuitive Input: Describe your memecoin with a simple prompt
  - Example: `Create a memecoin named BeamX with a total supply of 1 billion tokens`
- Automatic Parameter Extraction:

  - Token name
  - Symbol
  - Total supply
  - Decimal precision

#### 2. Seamless Blockchain Deployment

- Powered by [`Ekubo`](https://ekubo.org/) Protocol on StarkNet
- One-click deployment without complex blockchain knowledge
- Instant token generation and verification

#### 3. Output and Feedback to Users

   - After successful deployment:
     - The user receives a URL linking to the token's page or user could check for the token directly on [`StarkScan`](https://starkscan.co/).
   - Example output:  
      - `Your memecoin has been deployed! View it on StarkScan: [link]`.

#### 4. User-Friendly Experience

- No prior blockchain or coding expertise required
- Streamlined process from prompt to live token
- Immediate StarkScan link upon successful deployment


### üîÆ Roadmap and Future Enhancements
#### Planned Features

- Advanced tokenomics customization 
- AI-driven token name and parameter suggestions
- Multi-chain deployment support
- NFT metadata integration
- Community building tools
- Real-time token analytics dashboard
- Support for complex governance and staking mechanisms
